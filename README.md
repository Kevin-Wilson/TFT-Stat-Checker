# TFT-Stat-Checker
A repository that I will use to develop a simple program, practicing the use of python libraries and web crawling.

### Brief

I'm looking to improve my general coding skills, as well as building more familiarity with Python. I am going to create a program that gets the latest statistical data for TFT. As a vague idea of the process, I will somehow query the data for the top 5 comps in the current meta, I will write this data to a .csv file and display it with the pandas library. 

1. Connect to the website
2. FOR each unit, search an avg. place
3. Write as a line to the file
4. Read the CSV
