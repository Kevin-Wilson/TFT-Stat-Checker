# TFT-Stat-Checker
A repository that I will use to develop a simple program, practicing the use of python libraries and web crawling.

### Brief

I'm looking to improve my general coding skills, as well as building more familiarity with Python. I am going to create a program that gets the latest statistical data for TFT. As a vague idea of the process, I will somehow query the data for the top 5 comps in the current meta, I will write this data to a .csv file and display it with the pandas library. 

1. Connect to the website
2. Store the name of each comp and avg. place
3. Write as a line to the file
4. Read the CSV


### Context

In order for Javascript to actually be executed, it is usually run by your browser. By simply taking the HTML or JS, you are likely to get the unmodified data, which may not be what you want. Some libraries allow you to run the Javascript without a browser (abstraction is your friend...). 

The libraries used are pandas and requestsHTML
